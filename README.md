# SEP11 Freedom Project
by Jiang Hui Zheng

## Context
The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is all about how we can use javascript to create a product that will benefit people's lives. The purpose of this blog is to show the process of learning firebase and how I overcome my challenges.

## Content
For my project, I am making a typing game with my partner Junjie Li. I worked on score storage board with firebase while he work on the game itself. This blog will walk through my process of independently studying javascript and firebase in order to reach my product.

## Implications
Our game can help people socially, economically. Friends who play our game can compete over the score that they get in the game and have fun at the same time which strengthens their relationship. Players will also improve their typing speed on a computer while playing the game. This would make it easier for them to be hired in jobs that needs their employees to type very fast and more efficiently. Faster typing speed can also help people write their essays more efficiently which saves a lot of time. However, the game might also have a negative impact on the society. For example, kid might be too addicted to our game and affects their daily lives.
