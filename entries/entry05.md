# Entry 5: creating and testing MVP
##### 4/17/23

I am currently on step 5 and 6, creating and testing the MVP for my Freedom Project. I am using firebase to build a leaderboard that stores your score in the database and you can also search for the score based on the username the user entered in the input section. In order to build this, I need to write a code that can add data into my firebase storage. I learned how to use `addDoc()` from my last blog but I noticed that there is a better option which is `setDoc()`. `setDoc` allows me to add data just like `addDoc()` but it also allow me to set the id of the data added to whatever I want.
