# Entry 1: Picking and confirming my Tool
##### 11/8/22

I am currently at **stage 1** of the **<ins>Engineering Design Process: defining my tool</ins>**. The tool I chose for my freedom project is **firebase**, the reason I chose **firebase** as my tool for the project because I think storing data is really important when you're creating an app or a game. **Firebase** is the tool that allows me to storege the user's data.

I am going to make a score board in a game using my tool, **firebase**. I am working on my **freedom project** with my partner, he is going to work on the game part and I am going to work on the data storage part. I used the firebase [website](https://firebase.google.com/) to help me learn about **firebase** and also create my own **firebase project**. I also used this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIN07bJ0pFM) to help me set up the things like authentication and Firestore database inside the **firebase project**.

The skills that I've learned is **Growth Mindset** and **How to Google**. Whenever I am confused when I'm learning my tool, I always ask questions and try to learn things. I also had to research for many things in order to learn about my tool and I have to identitfy if the source is reliable or not. Therefore I learn the skill **Growth Mindset** and **How to Google**.
