# Entry 6:Result/Takeaways
##### 5/26/23

Our freedom Project is finished and we presented it in class and also did an elevator pitch during the expo. I am currently  at stage 8 of the Engineering Design Process: Communicate the results. I've gotten lots of feedback on how to improve my freedom project and my presentation skills.  The feedback that I get most frequently is to give more eye contact during my presentations and I know that it is the biggest component that I need to improve on. However, I've also improved alot since last year when I was in sep10. I was able to stop swaying around when I'm presenting because it might distract my audience and I was often told to stop that.
