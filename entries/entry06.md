# Entry 6:Result/Takeaways
##### 5/26/23

Our freedom Project is finished and we presented it in class and also did an elevator pitch during the expo. I am currently  at stage 8 of the Engineering Design Process: Communicate the results. I've gotten lots of feedback on how to improve my freedom project and my presentation skills. This is the link to our presentation [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DlBsuCo2btYgjM0rnWKOzWDL7PRuZVDRET_R7uEoy9w/edit#slide=id.p).  The feedback that I get most frequently is to give more eye contact during my presentations and I know that it is the biggest component that I need to improve on. However, I've also improved alot since last year when I was in sep10. I was able to stop swaying around when I'm presenting because it might distract my audience and I was often told to stop that. During the expo, I was told that I need to improve on my explaination skills because sometimes I might get nervous and forget the script that I wrote in my [note](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QXkwe2cgfv5vsp1Z-g5p9vEcKz21shzvSv_pI5Ve9tA/edit#heading=h.i2r9vdne8gdz). In order to do better next time I will practice my presentation skills more often and try to remember my script for the expo.

For skills, I've learned *Communication* and *Collaboration*. when my partner and I were creating our slides for the presentation and the scripts for the expo, we often share our ideas with each other. We were communicating a lot more than before because we know that it's impossible to finish it without collaboration.
