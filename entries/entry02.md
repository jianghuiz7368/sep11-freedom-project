# Entry 2: Learning Tool
##### 12/12/22

I am currently on **Stage 2** of the **<ins>Engineering Design Process: Learning my Tool</ins>**. During the past few weeks, I've learned many things about firebase. When I was learning Firebase, I didn't know how to install my firebase project into my IDE and I was stuck for a long time. I spend a lot of time researching and asking people around me I finally learned how to add Firebase to my Javascript project from the help of this [website](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup) and this tutorial [video](https://youtu.be/rQvOAnNvcNQ). I learned that to install firebase you need to do `npm install firebase` in your terminal and then you create an app in your firebase project.
