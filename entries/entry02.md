# Entry 2: Learning Tool
##### 12/12/22

I am currently on **Stage 2 and 3** of the **<ins>Engineering Design Process where Im researching and earning my tool</ins>**. During the past few weeks, I've learned many things about firebase. When I was learning Firebase, I didn't know how to install my firebase project into my IDE and I was stuck for a long time. I spend a lot of time researching and asking people around me. After a few days of researching, I finally learned how to Install the SDK and initialize Firebase with the help of this [website](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup) and this tutorial [video](https://youtu.be/rQvOAnNvcNQ). From the website and video, I learned that in order to install firebase you need to do `npm install firebase` in your terminal and then you create an app in your firebase project. To initialize firebase in your app, you need to write this code

```js
import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';

const firebaseConfig = {
  
};
```
Inside the curly brackets you copy and paste your firebase project configuration so it knows which project to connect to.

After that, I watched a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK2NoOoqyRo&feature=emb_title) by The Net Ninja which teached me how to set up a webpack. The video told me to make a package.json and make a webpack.config.js file. The webpack bundles the different pieces of imported source code together into a final javascript bundle called `bundle.js` and this is the file the html page is linked to.

I've also started to learn how to add Google Analytics to my app. Eventhough I haven't fully understand it but, I learned some basics like the Google Analytics are used to log events in your app and events is the things happening in your app like user action. In the future I would like to completely learn how to use Google Analytics in my apps so I can start logging event and collecting the data of how the user is behaving on my app or how they are using my app.

Since the last blog entry I've enhanced my skill of How to Google and Time Management. I did a lot of researching in order to learn about my tool and that caused me to get better at searching for the informations that I need. I also make plans for what I need to complete in each day and I always make sure that I am able to finish my task before the due date.
