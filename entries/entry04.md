# Entry 4: Tinkering and making
##### 3/13/23

I am currently on the **3rd and 4th step** of **the Engineering Design Process**, since my last blog I've been trying to figure out a solution that I've encountered when I was tinkering with firebase. At first, I thought the code I wrote is incorrect however, no matter what I do to the code it still shows the same error message. Then I saw the error messaging showing something about my `bundle.js' file so I thought there was something wrong with the linking between the bundle.js and my index.html. The only solution I can think of is to redo everything and remake all of my files. Therefore, I had to rewatch the videos from this [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jERUGvbudErNCeSZHWUVlb). After remaking all the files and rewriting all the codes, I checked the console and it finally worked. It showed all of the data I added inside the database in the console.

Now that my data is able to be shown in the console, I went on and learn how to add and delete data based on the user's input.
